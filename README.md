# In this repository you will find:
#   1. Trainings_Colab_Frames.ipynb
##This is the training colab with which I have trained the neural networks
##It works in combination with the webservice Roboflow which allows for anotation, augmentation and implementation of training images
##In order to use it for your own purposes you have to create a Roboflow account and change the links to the tfrecord files as instructed in the tutorial
##I have included the tfrecord file .zip of my own training sets

#   2. FERTIG_Object_Detection_Frames.ipynb
##This is the implementation of the first object detection neural network
##It detects the frames attached to the elements and outputs their coordinates
##To use it you have to link the colab to your google drive and change the paths in the script respectively 
##All necessary data to run the colab as is can be found in the frames.zip

# 3. FERTIG_Object_Detection_Markers.ipynb
##This is the implementation of the second object detection neural network
##It detects the markers inside the frames and outputs their coordinates
##To use it you have to link the colab to your google drive and change the paths in the script respectively
##All necessary data to run the colab as is can be found in the markers.zip
